In this project, we had two goals.
The first one was to compare the different SSH libraries (netSSH in Ruby, Paramiko in Python) and TakTuk which use a Perl library.
We used the Grid'5000 a scientific instrument for the study of large scale parallel and distributed systems.

The second goal was to program an REST API using Sinatra (a Ruby framework) for deploying nodes and for controlling them on the Grid'5000.
